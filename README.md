# Barbie Names API

This is a simple Barbie Movie API I created for practice. It shows Barbie movies, when they were released, what series they were a part of, who plays Barbie, and if I personally own the VHS/DVD.

# How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express

To create this I learned how to use API's and how to actually use Node. I was able to also apply new skills and learn Express through this process, which made the process of using Node a lot easier. I will certainly be using Express in the future to help simplify the process of creation and to work smarter not harder. This API has all the basics needed and is hosted. During the process of creation I learned to also use the Postman and Heroku to check that get's were working and providing the responses needed and then to host.

# Optimizations

August 28, 2023 - No longer hosted on Heroku as they no longer list free options. Also added a gitignore file to the project and reuploaded so that it didn't include all the node modules.

# Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot of new pieces on how to create back-end applications that I can already see having a wide variety of uses for the rest of my career as a software engineer. I was able to tackle hosting, Node, and Express all within the same project and it's pretty incredible to see even with this tiny API all of the things that I will be able to do with CRUD apps in the future.
